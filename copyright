 1. Definitions
 .
 a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work
 and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
 derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
 literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
 cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may
 be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably
 derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a
 Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
 this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
 work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
 timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
 Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
 .
 b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works,
 such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
 broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
 in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
 arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
 which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
 with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
 independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a

 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to
 reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights
 arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in
 connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other
 applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
 License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
 non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
 copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated
 below:
 .
 a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
 Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
 Collections;
 .
 b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
 Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable
 steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes
 were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be
 marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or
 a modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
 .
 c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
 incorporated in Collections; and,
 .
 d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
 .
 e. For the avoidance of doubt:
 .
 i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
 which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
 compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves
 the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
 of the rights granted under this License;
 .
 ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
 which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
 compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the
 exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of
 the rights granted under this License; and,
 .
 iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
 collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the
 Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers
 voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by
 You of the rights granted under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether
 now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to
 make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the
 rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all
 rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
 a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the
 terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform
 Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the
 Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose
 any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the
 ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted
 to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not
 sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to
 this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of
 the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
 Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective
 technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a
 recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that
 recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies
 to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not
 require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject
 to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice
 from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from
 the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
 If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must,
 to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
 required by Section 4(c), as requested.
 .
 b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under
 the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License
 with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative
 Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version)
 that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,
 Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible
 License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses
 mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If
 you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses
 mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must
 comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the
 following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for,
 the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You
 Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any
 terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable
 License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise
 the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
 Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer
 to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with
 every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute
 or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the
 Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures
 on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
 Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
 under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies
 to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not
 require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made
 subject to the terms of the Applicable License.
 .
 c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations
 or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
 Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
 provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
 name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
 supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate
 another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing
 entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in
 Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
 means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work
 if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
 any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless
 such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
 information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b),
 in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the
 Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
 Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
 Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented
 in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
 Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a
 credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection
 appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as
 prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the
 avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this
 Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above
 and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not
 implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
 sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or
 Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
 without the separate, express prior written permission of the
 Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
 .
 d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
 otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute
 or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
 Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
 take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be
 prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor
 agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any
 exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the
 right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
 mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to
 the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive
 or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
 permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably
 exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make
 Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
 LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
 STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
 TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
 NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
 OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
 SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
 SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
 APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY
 LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
 EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
 EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
 a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
 automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
 Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
 from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
 terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
 compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
 survive any termination of this License.
 .
 b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
 here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in
 the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
 release the Work under different license terms or to stop
 distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
 election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
 license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms
 of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
 effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
 a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
 Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
 Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
 under this License.
 .
 b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,
 Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on
 the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
 this License.
 .
 c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
 applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
 the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
 action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
 reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid
 and enforceable.
 .
 d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
 breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
 and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
 .
 e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
 with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
 agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
 here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
 may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
 modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
 You.
 .
 f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in
 this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
 Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
 amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO
 Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty
 of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July
 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the
 relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
 enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
 implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
 law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
 copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
 License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the
 License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
 rights under applicable law.

 this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if

License: Artistic-1
 .
 The "Artistic License"
 Preamble
 .
 The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
 Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
 semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
 while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
 the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to
 make reasonable modifications.
 .
 Definitions:
 .
 "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
 Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created
 through textual modification.
 .
 "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
 modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the
 Copyright Holder as specified below.
 .
 "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights
 for the package.
 .
 "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this
 Package.
 .
 "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of
 media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on.
 (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but
 only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear
 the fee.)
 .
 "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself,
 though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means
 that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same
 conditions they received it.
 .
 1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of
 the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided
 that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and
 associated disclaimers.
 .
 2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
 derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A
 Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard
 Version.
 .
 3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way,
 provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file
 stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do
 at least ONE of the following:
 .
 a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make
 them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to
 Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a
 major archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright
 Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the
 Package.
 b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or
 organization.
 c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
 with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a
 separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
 documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
 d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 .
 4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
 executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
 .
 a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library
 files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent)
 on where to get the Standard Version.
 b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the
 Package with your modifications.
 c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
 document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
 with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.
 d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 .
 5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of
 this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
 Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However,
 you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
 commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial)
 software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package
 as a product of your own. You may embed this Package's interpreter
 within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed
 as a mere form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard
 Version of the interpreter is so embedded.
 .
 6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
 output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
 under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
 them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
 Package. If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
 Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a
 binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
 neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
 fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you
 do not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of
 this Package.
 .
 7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
 languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
 emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
 Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
 equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
 not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
 regression tests for the language.
 .
 8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is
 always permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded;
 that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's
 interfaces visible to the end user of the commercial distribution.
 Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.
 .
 9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or
 promote products derived from this software without specific prior
 written permission.
 .
 10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
 IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
 WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
